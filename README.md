# Promonta Mini App

Telegram Mini App for Promonta, a construction company operating in Chemnitz/Sachsen, Germany. Used internally by the owner and field workers to manage construction sites, worker assignments, shift check-in/out, absence requests, defect tickets, tool/equipment tracking, team chat, and a news/photo feed — all inside Telegram.

Live at: **https://app.promonta.fun/app.html** (Telegram WebApp, opens inside Telegram client)

## Status

Actively developed, in production. No formal versioning yet (pre-1.0). See [docs/PROJECT_STATE.md](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md) for the current operational snapshot — that file is the first thing to read after any session loss.

## Roles

- **owner** — full access: manage objects, assign workers, approve absence requests, resolve critical alerts, see budgets/financials.
- **worker** — field access: see own assigned object, check in/out with GPS+photo, request absence, report defects/material needs, chat.

Role is looked up from `roles.json` by Telegram user ID; unknown IDs get a hard 403 (whitelist-only access since a "Фаза 10.1" hardening — not a silent worker default). See [docs/ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md](docs/ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md).

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework, no bundler. Single-page shell (`app.html`) + per-feature JS modules loaded as plain `<script>` tags from `js/`. Telegram WebApp JS SDK for host integration (initData, haptics, theming, safe-area).
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI (`main.py`, 148 routes, single file). Auth via Telegram WebApp `initData` HMAC validation, plus (since 2026-08-03) a 12-hour backend session token (`POST /api/session`) issued after one initData check — no separate login system, no JWT library, no session cookies.
- **Data storage**: flat JSON files on disk (no database, no ORM, no migrations). See [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) for the full list of stores and known race-condition mitigations (atomic write + per-file locks). Critical stores (`checkin_meta.json`, `chat_messages.json`, `mangel_tickets.json`, and most others) write atomically (temp-file + `os.replace`) — see [docs/RELEASE_AUDIT.md](docs/RELEASE_AUDIT.md) for the full audit.
- **Shared modules** (`objekte_lib.py`, `mangel_lib.py`, `tools_lib.py`, `roadmap_lib.py`): historically these lived only on the VPS outside git. All four are now tracked in `backend/` and loaded via an isolated `importlib`-based loader (not a plain `import`) so `main.py` always resolves the repo-tracked version, not a possibly-stale copy on disk — a clean `git clone` + deploy reproduces working code for all of them (see RELEASE_AUDIT.md, marked historical, for the original untracked-module findings).
- **AI features**: Claude (via `CLAUDE_BIN` CLI bridge) and GLM as fallback, for chat assistant and voice-note transcript extraction (`faster-whisper` for STT).
- **PDF generation**: `pypdf`, for Angebot (quotes) and Rechnung (invoices).

Runtime data (JSON stores, uploaded photos, generated PDFs, `.venv`, `node_modules`) lives on the VPS at `/home/promonta/agent/miniapp/*.json` and adjacent upload directories (`object_photos/`, `chat_attachments/`, `checkin_photos/`, etc.) — outside this repo, never committed, see `.gitignore`. It contains personal data of employees and must not leave the server without authorization. Full inventory: [docs/BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md](docs/BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md).

## Local development

**There is no local dev environment set up yet.** Development has historically happened by editing files directly on the production VPS with manual timestamped backups (`*.bak-pre-<change>-<timestamp>`) before each risky edit, then restarting the systemd service. This is fragile and is the main reason a lost session could not be reconstructed — see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) and [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) for the plan to fix this.

To run the backend locally (untested, first person to try this should update this section):

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# requires BOT_TOKEN and other vars from .env.example
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Frontend has no build step — open `frontend/app.html` directly, but it expects Telegram WebApp context (`window.Telegram.WebApp`) and will not fully function in a plain browser tab without stubbing that out.

## Checks

- **Automated tests**: `tests/*.py`, plain stdlib `unittest` (runnable directly via `pytest` — installed as a test-only dependency, see `requirements-test.txt` — or `python3 -m unittest tests.test_X`). As of 2026-08-03: 355 tests passing + 1 pre-existing skip, fully offline (no real Google Sheets/Telegram calls — route handlers called directly with mocked dependencies, `BOT_TOKEN` can be any dummy string for HMAC-signature tests). See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same checks (Python syntax, JS syntax, full test suite, required-file presence, merge-conflict markers, obvious-secrets scan) on every push/PR. *(Note: this workflow file exists in the repo working tree but could not be pushed in the session that authored it — the deploying GitHub OAuth token lacked the `workflow` scope required to create/update `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Push it manually or with a token that has that scope before relying on it.)*
- **No lint/typecheck configured** — Python has no `ruff`/`mypy`, JS has no `eslint`/TypeScript. Only `py_compile`/`node --check` syntax validation.
- Manual pre-deploy checklist: [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md), release checklist: [docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

## Git workflow

- `main` — stable, deployed state.
- `docs/...`, `fix/...`, `feat/...`, `chore/...` — work branches. See [docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).
- Every functional commit should touch `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and `docs/FEATURES.md` if applicable — see governance rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
- No force-push, no history rewriting without explicit owner approval.

## Recovering from a lost session

1. Read [docs/PROJECT_STATE.md](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md) and [docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md](docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md) first.
2. Run `git log --oneline -20` and `git status` in this repo.
3. Compare against the live VPS state — the production frontend is served from `/var/www/miniapp/app.html` and backend from `/home/promonta/agent/miniapp/main.py`; this repo is a curated copy. If they've diverged, the VPS is the source of truth until re-synced (see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).
4. Check `docs/TODO.md` for the next planned step.

## Health / diagnostics

- `GET /api/health` — unauthenticated liveness probe. Returns `status`, `service`, `version`, `commit`, `time`. No secrets, no internal paths. `version`/`commit` come from a `VERSION` file written by `scripts/deploy.sh` next to `main.py` on deploy (not a `git` subprocess on every request — the serving path isn't even a git repo).
- `GET /api/health/ready` — owner-only readiness check for internal monitoring. Cheap filesystem checks only (storage dirs writable, `tools_lib.py`/`mangel_lib.py` present, `roles.json` present) — never a live Google Sheets call on every poll.

## Deploy / rollback

- `scripts/deploy.sh` — full pre-flight (clean git status, on `main`, full test suite, Python/JS syntax) → timestamped backup → copy `main.py` + `tools_lib.py` + `mangel_lib.py` together into the serving path (they must live side-by-side — the isolated module loader resolves them relative to `main.py`'s own directory) → frontend sync → `systemctl restart` → `/api/health` check → tail of recent logs. Stops on the first failure.
- `scripts/rollback.sh <backup-dir>` — validates and restores a backup created by `deploy.sh`, restarts the service, re-checks health. Never deletes the backup it used.
- `scripts/cleanup_rollback_backups.sh [keep_count]` — retention for `/tmp/rollback_backup_*` only (default: keep last 5). Does not touch user data — see [docs/BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md](docs/BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md) for the actual data backup (a separate, pre-existing `promonta-backup.timer`).

## Required environment variables

- `BOT_TOKEN` — Telegram bot token, used for `initData` HMAC validation. **Never commit a real value.**
- Full list, including optional AI-related vars: [docs/ENVIRONMENT.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md).

## Known limitations

- No local dev environment (see "Local development" above) — all iteration happens against the live VPS.
- No automated visual/UI testing — Safari MCP browser automation is not currently functional in this environment; UI changes are verified by code review and manual Telegram testing, not automated screenshots.
- Full data-deletion-on-request ("right to be forgotten") is not implemented — see [docs/DATA_PROTECTION.md](docs/DATA_PROTECTION.md).

## Secrets warning

This repo must never contain `BOT_TOKEN`, `GLM_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, real employee personal data, or any file under `backend/*.json` (all runtime data, gitignored). See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) and [docs/ENVIRONMENT.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md).

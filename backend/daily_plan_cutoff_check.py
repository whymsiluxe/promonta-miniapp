"""daily_plan_cutoff_check.py — owner alerts around DailyPlan publishing timing.

Owner request (18.09): the plan should arrive the evening BEFORE the work day, not
be assembled the morning of. Neither alert here blocks a worker's shift start --
start without a plan stays freely allowed either way (checkin_start's existing
behavior, unchanged). Two modes, run by two separate systemd timers:

  evening (18:00) — reminder: any worker with an accepted assignment covering
    TOMORROW who has no plan yet for tomorrow. Owner still has the evening to
    publish it.
  morning (06:30) — overdue: any worker with an accepted assignment covering
    TODAY who still has no plan for today. The evening reminder was missed.

Does NOT run inline in FastAPI request handlers -- invoked by systemd timers,
same standalone-script pattern as backend/cleanup_old_attachments.py.

Deploy: like cleanup_old_attachments.py, this file is NOT copied automatically by
scripts/deploy.sh's manifest (it isn't imported by main.py, so it isn't a runtime
dependency of the app) -- copy it manually into the runtime package directory,
next to main.py (/home/promonta/agent/miniapp/), so `import main as backend`
below resolves the same top-level `main` module the systemd uvicorn service and
every tests/test_*.py file use (as opposed to the `miniapp.main` package import
uvicorn itself uses -- see main.py's own relative/absolute import fallback
comment for why both forms exist side by side in this codebase).

Usage:
  python3 daily_plan_cutoff_check.py evening   # 18:00 timer
  python3 daily_plan_cutoff_check.py morning   # 06:30 timer (default if omitted,
                                                # for backward compat with the
                                                # original single-timer deploy)

Idempotency: writes a per-day, per-mode marker to
$MINIAPP_DATA_ROOT/daily_plan_cutoff_state.json so a timer misfire/retry on the
same day does not spam duplicate alerts. The two modes use separate state keys
so one running twice in a day (e.g. a manual test run) can't suppress the other.
